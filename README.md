# AI/ML for 5G Energy Consumption Prediction

This project explores machine learning approaches to model and predict the energy consumption of 5G base stations. The goal is to improve prediction accuracy and model efficiency by leveraging recent advancements in artificial intelligence. The model should predict the energy consumption of 5G infrastructure in various network scenarios. The project and the dataset have been provided by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as part of the [AI/ML for 5G Energy Consumption Modelling](https://zindi.africa/competitions/aiml-for-5g-energy-consumption-modelling) competition on Zindi in 2023.
